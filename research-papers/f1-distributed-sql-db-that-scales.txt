Title: F1: A Distributed SQL Database That Scales

Key points:
1. Provides scalablity/high availablity of no sql and usablity/ consistency of sql databases. what do they mean by usablity in sql db is related ACID properties or relational tables?
2. F1 is distributed relational database, which seems interesting as in a distributed systems maintaining strong consistency seems challnging.
3. sync replication means high latenecy and they are saying it is getting mitigated using hierarchical schema model with structured data
types, what does it even means?
3. F1 has fully functional distributed SQL query engine and automatic change tracking and publishing.

Questions for later exploration:
1. F1 is built on Spanner. What is Spanner? it say spanner provides strong consistency and sync cross data center replication, are these two interelated?
2. scalable and highly available system like big table what is it. how resharding is challenging? 
3. OLTP and OLAP databases?
4. How sharing works? internally? notes from paper: "resharding data without breaking applications was challenging".
5. Revise cap theorem.

F1 was created to replace a sharded MySQL implementation, in order to meet the increasing scalability and reliability demands.

The key goals achieved through the F1 database are:

Scalability: Complex queries requiring data sharing were previously limited by sharding, but F1's design allows for greater scalability.
Availability: As the data is critical to Google's core business, the system must be highly available to prevent downtime impacting revenue.
Consistency: Transactions must be ACID compliant and data must be correct and consistent. 
concurrency anomalies is error prone and time consuming basically not worth the performance gain.
Usability: SQL query support is essential for ad-hoc queries.
